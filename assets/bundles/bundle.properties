block.eso-toggler.name = Enabler
block.eso-toggler.description = Enables or disables the block in front of it depending on input signal.

block.eso-display.name = Display
block.eso-display.description = Shines yellow when it receives a signal. Any rumors of it acting like a Signal Diode are false.

block.eso-matrix.name = Display Matrix
block.eso-matrix.description = Displays a 256x256 2-bit color image, configurable with signals. Back 8 bits is vertical coordinates, left 8 bits is horizontal coordinates, right 8 bits from back to front (rr/gg/bb/write/clear). Front is vertical coordinates passthrough.

block.eso-signal-diode.name = Signal Diode
block.eso-signal-diode.description = Only allows signals to travel in one direction.

block.eso-or-gate.description = At least 1 input has to be on for an output.

block.eso-not-gate.name = NOT Gate
block.eso-not-gate.description = Inverts the input. If more inputs are present, it acts as a NOR gate.

block.eso-xor-gate.name = XOR Gate
block.eso-xor-gate.description = Outputs a signal if the number of input signals is odd. Otherwise, it remains off.

block.eso-bi-xor-gate.name = Bilateral XOR Gate
block.eso-bi-xor-gate.description = Outputs a signal if only 1 signal is on, otherwise off. Sides act as a bidirectional wire, allowing for easy chaining.

block.eso-memory.name = Signal Memory
block.eso-memory.description = Stores 256 Bytes of memory. Front is read output, back is write input, left is address in, right is from back to front (write enable/read enable). If persistence mode is enabled, the previous read output stays when read enable is off.

block.eso-drawer.name = Display Flusher
block.eso-drawer.description = Connects a source Display Matrix to a target Display Matrix. Upon receiving a signal, it copies all data from the source to target, allowing to make large seamless displays.
